# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: Ruby Hashes are similar to arrays, but instead of being enclosed in square brackets [] they are enclosed in curly brackets {}. Hashes in Ruby are known to hold data in form of key value pairs.

Researched answer: 
Ruby Hashes are another collection data structure; it is composed of a varible name, assignment operator, and key value pairs (enclosed in curly brackets). Unlike an array, Hashes are accessible to only key values not indexes.

e.g. 
juices = {:apple_juice => 4 ,
          :cranberry_juice => 2}
juices[:apple_juice] = 4 
OR
juices = {apple_juice: 4 ,
          cranberry_juice: 2}
juices[:apple_juice] = 4 

The former and latter have different notations for their key value pairs, but note that they way to call back a specific key value pair is identical. 

Additional intresting point is that Hashes can store other referential data types: arrays, objects, and even more hashes. The thing is, is that a hash within a array within a hash may be very diffcult to read. 


2. What is a gem?

Your answer: Gems are library components of Rails, very similiar to React's library. They both offer seemless paths for integrating other people's components into a new project. 

Researched answer:
A gem is an indivdual package from a Ruby library. It's almost like installing an app, as a gem has a name, and version number associated to it. Gems are essentially the same thing as a gem, but its plural. Gems are a collection of libraries or applications put into one package that can be installed with one command line: use gem install [gem_name]. I personally have not installed a gem package before, but I'm sure I have used it before as a testing suite for Ruby code.
